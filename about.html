            Hello! My name is Ashlyn, the lead crocheter at Hooks & Happiness.
            I first learned to crochet 8 years ago and picked it back up again 
            2 years ago. Since then I've started selling plushies here at Hooks
            & Happiness. A fun fact about me is that I love narwhals!

            Hi! I'm Paige, the yarn-supplier at Hooks & Happiness. I've been crocheting for about 2 years,
            and am the one responsible for finding all the best yarn for plushies! 
            We hand select the yarn for softness and the most vibrant colors.

            Hey there! My name is Tiffany, I don't have a lot of experience with crocheting yet, 
            I only picked up the hobby about a year ago.  However, I've found that the more time
            I devote to it, the more I enjoy it. I love creating unique items and welcome the challenge of
            custom orders. My favorite thing to do when I'm not crocheting is spending time in my gardens!
