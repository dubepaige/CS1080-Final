      Hello! My name is Ashlyn, the lead crocheter at INSERT NAME HERE.
      I first learned to crochet 8 years ago and picked it back up again 
      2 years ago. Since then I've started selling plushies here at Hooks
      & Happiness. A fun fact about me is that I love narwhals!

      Hi! I'm Paige, the yarn-supplier at Hooks & Happiness. I've been crocheting for about 2 years,
      and am the one responsible for finding all the best yarn for plushies!

      Hey there! My name is Tiffany, I don't have a lot of experience with crocheting, 
      I only picked up the hobby about a year ago.  However, I've found that the more time
      I devote to it, the more I enjoy it. I love creating unique items and welcome the challenge of
      custom orders. My favorite thing to do when I'm not crocheting is spending time in my gardens!
